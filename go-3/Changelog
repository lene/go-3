0.4.3
-----

- handling of various errors:
  - no server running on provided host/port
  - user of same name already connected
  - Java3D not installed or not found
- added a CursorDialog which displays the cursor coordinates and allows an
  additional method to set stones and display a grid place's liberties.
- added a NavigationDialog too, but it's still buggy and is opened only in debug
  mode.

0.4.2
-----

- Sanitized the login process - the first dialog only to log on to the server, 
  the second contains tabs for listing available games and starting a new one
- updating the list of available games works
- refactoring the mentioned dialogs to have cleaner code
- added ant file, build instructions etc.

0.4.1
-----

- optimized startup script to correctly detect JVM version, 
  Java3D installation and g3d installation

- created a config file structure

- refactored source to use package structure:
  net.hyperspacetravel.go3
  net.hyperspacetravel.go3.server
  net.hyperspacetravel.go3.client
  net.hyperspacetravel.go3.client.gui

0.4.0
-----

This is the first public release. Its state is early alpha.

It has a couple of known bugs and probably many unknown.

This is the first version containing a multi-game server, so I decided to 
release it.
