	TO DO LIST for go3d on 14 Feb 2006
	==================================


	1) Short-term
	-------------

make a jar and upload it to SourceForge

user, installation and protocol documentation

advertising

start server on hyperspace-travel.de

  2) 0.4.x
  --------

Main feature: Multi-game server
-------------

Bugs:
-----  

buggy reconnecting of clients - deadlock if current player disconnects
bug when player 0 disconnects

display correctly after (re-)connecting
when game starts (perhaps on other occasions before starting), the cursor is set
to 0,0,0.

bug when setting into a field with no liberties left: the SETTING player is 
cleared (at least sometimes)

Cleanups:
---------

implement read() and write() routines for the Protocols, which acknowledge the 
read command by repeating it, and repeat the written command if it is not
acknowledged

class hierarchy: derive a Server(Game) and a client class separately from GoGrid
the Server defines the method nextPlayer(), the client message()

disentangle the protocol from the client implementation
GoGridClient.java has to be cleaned up major league

Features:
---------

find a way to use the transparency (and other properties) setting functions in
all Shape3D or Sphere derived objects (i want multiple inheritance! )-:
ie. Cursor, Grid/GridObject, Stone, Point, Handicap

settings dialog at startup:	handicaps, load game, etc.

working menu


  3) 0.5.x
  --------
  
Main feature: object persistence - server survives a restart
-------------

Bugs:
-----

calculation af rotation angles from Transform3D	(for correct Picking)

Cleanups:
---------

recheck protocol - what instances can occur?				(code)

Features:
---------

messages between players - talk window, chat & messages line

display the captured stones in the background, along with their number

command line for clients to manually type commands, needs an interface



Picking: 								(bugfix)
	  better transform inverse (see transformation behaviors) 
	  enable picking for occupied points 

saving and restoring games



	4) Later
	----------------

fix all remaining bugs
	[xyz]set in J3DApp should show last move

profile code and optimize hotspots


	5) Mid-term
	-----------

UI study (with Mi, and possibly other users)

user management 

add a control window							(feature)

	finally:controls to manipulate the board
		moving the cursor
		setting
		chat & messages line
		get & display liberties
		visual depth?

integrate display, control window and talk line into one frame		(hmm.. usability feat)

Cursor: change color according to what's under the cursor as well 	?

Separate functionalities - grid (setting, getting, checking, 		(code)
liberties, the like), actual implementation (server/client),
integration with graphics

One-player-game (with better computer opponent, possibly)		(feature)

handicap markers: tiny coarse spheres istead of tetheds			("bug"fix)

rendering improvements/adjustments					(feature)
	lighting on/off 
	material -> color info 
	adjustable depth of perspective 
	antialiased spheres

count captives								(feature)


	6) Long-term
	------------

count eyes								

Better, more intelligent computer player 				

cursor for lines and planes 						

cut away or fade parts of the grid for better orientation 		

undo capability and forking of the game					

logging of games, preferably to MySQL database, for analysis

server-side setting of multiple cursors					PREPARED

server-side graphical display w/ multiple cursors			
	+ hooking into running games

fly-through mode							

multiple views 								

more players 								

different sizes in x, y and z						PREPARED

different geometries:							
	toroidal space (in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions)			
	4D?!								
	tetrahedral or dodecahedral (or what else?) connections
